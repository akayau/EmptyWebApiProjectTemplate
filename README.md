# EmptyWebApiProjectTemplate
This is a much emptier project template for ASP.NET Web API. The concepts are adapted from [ReallyEmptyMvcProjectTemplate](https://github.com/Haacked/ReallyEmptyMvc3ProjectTemplate).

# Installation
* __MAKE SURE ALL INSTANCES OF VISUAL STUDIO ARE CLOSED!__
* Run the 'build.cmd' batch file to make the VSIX installer for the template.  Then copy that file to your Visual Studio installation and double-click the .vsix file to install.

The batch file:

* Creates the project package (a zip file).
* Packages the template up in the Visual Studio installer extensible package (VSIX).

# DISCLAIMER
I've tested this on my machine, but not yours. I make no guarantees that it'll work fine. See the license at the end.
